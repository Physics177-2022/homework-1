# Homework 1

**Due Friday, April 8**

The goal of our first homework assignment is simply to get you acquainted with the primary tools we'll be using in this class: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 1. Install Python 3

Check the [download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for Python 3 and install it locally on your system. There are instructions here to install Python on the standard Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. If you're using something else, such as a [Chromebook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/), there are some workarounds -- see below!

## 2. Install Jupyter

Jupyter is a convenient environment for writing code, performing computations or analysis, and sharing them with others. We'll use Jupyter notebooks with code written in Python, but it can also be used with other coding languages. Go to the [download page](https://jupyter.org/install.html) and install Jupyter.

It's up to you how to install Python and Jupyter, but one easy way to do both is through the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), which contains many popular Python packages.

What if you can't install Python and Jupyter on your machine? In that case, you can also use Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). This is not as fast or convenient as running code locally on your own computer, but it does make Jupyter notebooks and Python accessible for anyone with access to a web browser.

## 3. Join GitHub

Sign up for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/) using your UCR email address. It's a good idea to choose a professional user name, because the work you post on GitHub can be an important part of your CV when applying for academic or industry positions.

Follow [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/rXJKfKSU) to sign up for GitHub Classroom and download a copy of this repository.

## 4. Practice basic Jupyter

Now that you have Python and Jupyter installed, you can open up the [Jupyter notebook](./homework-1.ipynb) in this repository for the rest of the assignment.
